              Single Cell ProtEomics by Mass Spectrometry (SCoPE-MS) and

              based on their proteomes. We use SCoPE-MS to quantify over a
              thousand proteins in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells.
              The single-cell proteomes enable us to deconstruct cell
              populations and infer protein abundance relationships. Comparison
              between single-cell proteomes and transcriptomes indicates
              coordinated mRNA and protein covariation, yet many genes exhibit
              functionally concerted and distinct regulatory patterns at the

  abstract = "The performance of ultrasensitive LC-MS/MS methods, such as
              Single-Cell Proteomics by Mass Spectrometry (SCoPE-MS), depends
              on multiple interdependent parameters. This interdependence makes
              it challenging to specifically pinpoint bottlenecks in the
              LC-MS/MS methods and approaches for resolving them. For example,
              low signal at MS2 level can be due to poor LC separation,
              ionization, apex targeting, ion transfer, or ion detection. We
              sought to specifically diagnose such bottlenecks by interactively
              visualizing data from all levels of bottom-up LC-MS/MS analysis.
              Many search engines, such as MaxQuant, already provide such data,
              and we developed an open source platform for their interactive
              visualization and analysis: Data-driven Optimization of MS
              (DO-MS). We found that in many cases DO-MS not only specifically
              diagnosed bottlenecks but also enabled us to rationally optimize
              them. For example, we used DO-MS to diagnose poor sampling of the
              elution peak apex and to optimize it, which increased the
              efficiency of delivering ions for MS2 analysis by 370 \%. DO-MS
              is easy to install and use, and its GUI allows for interactive
              data subsetting and high-quality figure generation. The modular
              design of DO-MS facilitates customization and expansion. DO-MS is
              available for download from GitHub:

  abstract = "The fate and physiology of individual cells are controlled by
              networks of proteins. Yet, our ability to quantitatively analyze
              protein networks in single cells has remained limited. To
              overcome this barrier, we developed SCoPE2. It integrates
              concepts from Single-Cell ProtEomics by Mass Spectrometry
              (SCoPE-MS) with automated and miniaturized sample preparation,
              substantially lowering cost and hands-on time. SCoPE2 uses
              data-driven analytics to optimize instrument parameters for
              sampling more ion copies per protein, thus supporting
              quantification with improved count statistics. These advances
              enabled us to analyze the emergence of cellular heterogeneity as
              homogeneous monocytes differentiated into macrophage-like cells
              in the absence of polarizing cytokines. We used SCoPE2 to
              quantify over 2,000 proteins in 356 single monocytes and
              macrophages in about 85 hours of instrument time, and the
              quantified proteins allowed us to discern single cells by cell
              type. Furthermore, the data uncovered a continuous gradient of
              proteome states for the macrophage-like cells, suggesting that
              macrophage heterogeneity may emerge even in the absence of
              polarizing cytokines. Our methodology lays the foundation for
              quantitative analysis of protein networks at single-cell
